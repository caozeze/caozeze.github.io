<li>Conducted data processing with Pandas, managing null values, missing values, duplicates, and data formatting</li>
<li>Established a research outline for the visualisation of retention and activity rates across different dimensions</li>
<li>Implemented user segmentation based on the Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) model for precision operations</li>
<li>Conducted comparative analysis of user behaviour (cohort analysis) and behaviour correlation analysis</li>

<li>Identified key differential behaviours (Aha-Moment) between low-retention and high-retention users</li>
<li>Applied the RFM model for precision user operations and researched key indicators for improving retention rates</li>
<li>Provided core recommendations for platform operations, such as new user onboarding</li>

<p>Our data analysis objectives mainly include the following aspects:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Determine the frequency of different user actions on the platform and identify any trends or patterns.</li>
<li>Identify any anomalies in the frequency of user actions and investigate potential causes.</li>
<li>Analyse the correlation between different user actions.</li>
<li>Identify key user actions that influence other user behaviours.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2-2-Analysis-Results-and-Suggestions"><a href="#2-2-Analysis-Results-and-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="2.2. Analysis Results and Suggestions"></a>2.2. Analysis Results and Suggestions</h2><blockquote>
<p>Our data analysis reveals the following key insights:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The frequency of user actions on the platform (such as browsing, buying, sharing, liking) shows certain trends. For example, the frequency of user browsing behaviour has the highest similarity with the PV&#x2F;UV graph of the day&#x2F;month. There is an anomaly in the frequency of user collection behaviour in mid-August, but no explanatory factors can be proposed at present. The frequency of user rewarding behaviour has a peak in November, which may be related to the actual appearance of popular articles&#x2F;resources in November. User activity behaviour has certain peaks in July and December, but the specific effects need further observation.</li>
<li>The analysis raises some questions and speculations, such as: Does the behaviour object ID (target_id) contain other objects besides article objects (e.g., user objects, activity objects, product objects, etc.)? If a user buys&#x2F;likes&#x2F;shares&#x2F;collects&#x2F;participates in an activity, does the user need to view this page first? If a user gives a reward, what does the behaviour object ID (target_id) point to? Is it another user or an article?</li>
<li>The analysis provides answers to the above questions. For example, if a user buys&#x2F;likes&#x2F;shares&#x2F;collects, the user needs to view this page first. If a user gives a reward, the user definitely does not reward another user, nor a shareable and purchasable object. It may be a column or resource file (reward to download). If a user shares (Share), the user just shares the content (the first major class object).</li>
<li>The analysis also conducted a correlation analysis of various indicators, finding that whether it is high-quality users or overall users, they have a high degree of association in the following pairs of behaviours: view and buy, view and share, reward and share, reward and comp. Looking at the points where the difference in behaviour correlation between high-quality users and overall users is high, the correlation between vote and other behaviours has a large increase (except for buy). This may indicate that vote may be a key factor influencing other user behaviours.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2-3-Conclusion"><a href="#2-3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="2.3. Conclusion"></a>2.3. Conclusion</h2><p>Although the content of this analysis needs further improvement, it has already provided us with some important insights into user behaviour on the digital platform. We will continue to improve our analysis methods to provide a deeper and more comprehensive understanding.</p>

<p>Understanding consumer purchasing behaviour and preferences is crucial in the e-commerce platform. In this project, we utilise Python to process and analyse historical order data and user behaviour data from JD, a leading e-commerce platform, in an attempt to identify opportunities for optimisation within the e-commerce platform through statistical analysis and to provide pertinent recommendations.</p>

<p>Our data analysis reveals the following key findings, based on which we propose some marketing strategy suggestions:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Users have a high enthusiasm for electronic products and clothes, suggesting that the e-commerce platform could conduct joint promotions with related brands.</li>
<li>Users have high purchasing power during the Spring Festival, but the order amount drops after the festival, suggesting post-festival marketing activities to stimulate consumption.</li>
<li>Users prefer to browse and purchase on the e-commerce platform in the afternoon and evening, suggesting increased advertising efforts during these times.</li>
<li>More than half of the users have not logged into the e-commerce platform, suggesting activities to attract returning customers.</li>
